## What is React?

React is extremely popular, declarative, component-based, state-drive JavaScript Library for building user interfaces - created by Facebook.

-   Component-based: Components are building blocks of user interfaces. We build complex UIs by building and combining multiple components. Each section/aspect of a webpage is broken down into pieces (components).
    Components represents the NavBar, SearchBar, sections, footer, aside, buttons all fixed together eventually.

-   Declarative: We described how a component should look like and how they work using using a declaritive syntax called JSX (JS-XML). JSX is a syntax that combines HTML, CSS and JavaScript as well referencing other (React) components.

-   State: For example, a state in React is an array of products (data) to be rendered on the UI with JSX. Whenever this state is updated, React reacts to the State changes by re-rendering the UI.

-   JS-Library: React is a JavaScript Library which complies with other libraries (external) to build a complete application because React itself is only the "view" layer.

-   NB: React was created in 2011 by Jordan Walke, an engineer working at Facebook at the time. In 2013, React was open-sourced for everyone to use.

`It is no longer advisable to use Create-react-app to build professional projects but Vite is now recommended [vite.dev](vite.dev)`

## Setup React App

```cmd
npx create-react-app project_name
```

### Folder Structure

-   SRC: Where all development codes will go.
-   PUBLIC: Where all assets for the final app lives. Assets such as; images, logo, favicons etc

#### SRC Folder

-   App.js: Contains main component of the app.
-   index.js: Contains the React configuration and renders the components to the UI

#### Rendering Root Component & Strict Mode

-   The `index.js` file provided in the `src` folder renders the app-components in entirity
-   Here is where you need to import all React modules necessary

```javascript
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
import "./index.css";
```

-   Create a variable to store the div-element provided in the HTML with the ID of "root"

```javascript
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
```

-   Render this variable by inserting intended components

```javascript
root.render(
	<React.StrictMode>
		<App />
	</React.StrictMode>
);
```

-   HINT: The component can be created in the `index.js` file or imported from another file.
